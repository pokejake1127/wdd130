        <h2>Jacob Smith</h2>
            <p>I am from Federal Way, Washington, and I am studying Software Engineering with a minor in Music. </p>
            <p>I love playing all kinds of video games and watching anime. Likewise, I would love to work on a video game one day, but honestly I'd be fine doing anything with programming.</p>
